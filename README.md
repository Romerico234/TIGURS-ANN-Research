# TIGURS-ANN-Research

This repository contains the research I did for the TIGURS Undergraduate Research Program.

## Overview

My partner, Alazar Tekeba, and I focused on three types of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs):

1. **Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN)**
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**

Our research aimed to achieve a mathematical and theoretical understanding of these ANNs and to explore how to best tune the models to enhance their performance.

## Acknowledgments

I extend my gratitude to the TIGURS Undergraduate Research Program for providing this opportunity.
